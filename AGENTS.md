## Code quality principles (MANDATORY)

- Prioritize clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
- Prefer readability and explicitness over clever or compact solutions.
- Follow best practices and design patterns appropriate for the language, framework and project

## Design principles

- Always follow SOLID and KISS principles.
- Do not introduce unnecessary abstractions.
- Do not over-engineer solutions.

## Code hygiene

- Remove unused code only when it is clearly safe to do so.
- Do not remove code that is referenced indirectly or via reflection without confirmation.
- Do not perform large cleanup refactors unless explicitly requested.

## Task clarity

- If the task requirements are ambiguous or incomplete:
  - Stop before writing code.
  - Ask clarifying questions.
  - Do not guess or assume missing requirements.
